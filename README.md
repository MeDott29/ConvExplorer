## Features Added

1. **Data Structure Analysis** - The tool now understands your specific JSON schema with conversations, chat_messages, and content elements.

2. **Message Content Extraction** - It extracts message text from both the `text` field and the nested `content[].text` structure.

3. **Empty Message Detection** - Added functionality to identify and filter conversations with empty messages, which could be helpful for data cleanup.

4. **Message Distribution Chart** - A visual bar chart showing the distribution of messages by role (human/assistant), message length categories, and monthly activity.

5. **Export to Markdown** - Export any conversation to a readable Markdown file with proper formatting of messages by role.

6. **Improved Statistics** - Enhanced statistics including empty message counts, message length distribution, and time-based analysis.
